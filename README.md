# Energy Demand Forecaster with Machine Learning

This repository stores a Jupyter Notebook for energy demand forecasting using different machine learning algorithms, as part of a project for the [Institute for Integrated Energy Systems (IESVic)](https://www.uvic.ca/research/centres/iesvic/index.php) in fulfillement of the Technical Writing (ENGR 446) academic course at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/)

## Objective
This is a neural network application with the main task of predicting future energy demands (particularly space heat demand) profiles for the province of British Columbia, based on available data from the past
